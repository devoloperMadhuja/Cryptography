# Cryptography 
# Caesar Cipher:
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques used to communicate securely with different parties. The most widely used name is Caesar Cipher, though some people may call it Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or the Caesar shift.

In the Caesar Cipher, letters in plain text are replaced by other letters or symbols by shifting them a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This is why the Caesar Cipher is sub-categorized as a substitution technique.

This is the earliest known and simplest method of encryption, used by Julius Caesar and followed by many other military leaders to protect their communications during military operations.

Caesar preferred a shift of three, but today, a common use of the Caesar Cipher is called "ROT13." This stands for "rotate by 13 places," which means moving each letter of the alphabet 13 spots forward.

Importantly, this technique is not widely used today — that’s because it is easy to break.

# Example:
# Plaintext:
I am a Student.
# Shift:
3
# Ciphertext:
L dp d Vwxghqw.
